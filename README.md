A logistic regression model was applied to the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) to predict liver disease, achieving an accuracy of 76% using Python libraries. 
The implementation involved preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. 
The model's performance demonstrates its potential as a diagnostic tool for liver disease, particularly in resource-constrained settings
